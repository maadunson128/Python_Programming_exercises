'''Circle Intersection.
Write a program that computes the intersection of a circle with a horizontal
line and displays the information textually and graphically.
Input: Radius of the circle and they-intercept of the line.
Output: Draw a circle centered at (0, 0) with the given radius in a window
with coordinates running from -10,-10 to 10, 10.
Draw a horizontal line across the window with the given y-intercept.
Draw the two points of intersection in red.
Print out the x values of the points of intersection.
Formula: x = Â±y'r2 - y2'''
